Fantasy Congress 2018

The way the mainstream media covers Elections in this day in age leads to stories that only focus on the loudest and most outspoken members of either party being heard. This makes tracking Congressional Elections boring at best, because you keep hearing about the same races and the crazy thing that particular candidate said or did today. The Fantasy Congress 2018 App is designed to challenge users to dig into the data and narratives of lesser known races around the country and find the candidates destined to outperform expectations on Election Day 2018.

Operating under a similar model to Daily Fantasy Sports, once a user creates a profile they will be given $400 of fantasy money to allocate however they choose in order to fill a roster of 4 Senate Candidates and 8 House Candidates. The individual candidates will be priced based on their projected success, so the user won't be able to fill a team with 10 candidates running unopposed. Instead they will have to dig into all the resources at their disposal, looking at races all across the country, to figure out how they can put together the best possible team with their fantasy financial constraints.

As they look to put together their team, from the CANDIDATES VIEW users will be able to search for a specific candidate, or filter the candidate list by various constraints (party, chamber, state, or incumbent). With one click the user can add a candidate to their team. If however a team becomes too expensive, a user can also easily drop a candidate from their team from the TEAM VIEW.

This challenge is meant to be played among your friends, so anyone can set up a league and invite their friends to play. Up until election night on the LEAGUE VIEW all you'll be able to see is who is in your league, what their team name is, and whether or not your friend has submitted their roster. Once they're locked in at midnight on November 6th, 2018 (ELECTION DAY!) you can see all everyones' teams by navigating from the LEAGUE VIEW.

The scoring system is simple. One percent of the electorate is equal to 1 point (i.e. a candidate who receives 47.6% of the votes in their district earns the user 47.6 points). The team with the most points once all the votes are tallied wins!
